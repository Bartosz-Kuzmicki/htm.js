 * indicating whether the segment predicts feed-forward input on the next
 * time step. Segments can be either proximal or distal (for spatial pooling
 * or temporal pooling respectively) however the class object itself does not
 * need to know which it ultimately is as they behave identically.  Segments
 * are considered 'active' if enough of its existing synapses are connected
 * and individually active.
